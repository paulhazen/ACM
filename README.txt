This repo is for use by students of Marty Stepp's Spring 2012 Seminar CSE390B Course.

The current maintainer of the repository is paulhazen (paul-hazen@live.com). I will be happy to approve any pull requests sent to me on the repository, so long as they:

1. Are from students of the course
2. Are formatted correctly

To understand the folder structure of this repo:

Each Problem ought to be placed in a folder whose name appropriately describes the problem.

Example: "Waldo"

Waldo is an excellent name for a problem. 

Inside "Waldo" we have a file (pdf/doc/txt, doesn't really matter what the format is) titled "Question.[pdf/doc/txt]" wherein you ought to give a full description of the problem being solved (you might just want to copy/paste the contents of a web page in a word doc, and call it good).

The solutions to the problem stated in the "Question" file should each have their own folder.

Ideally, there is one "good" way to solve the question being asked, but invariably there is more than one way to solve the problem. Inside the problem folder, we will put folders for each solution we feel significantly differs from the others.
